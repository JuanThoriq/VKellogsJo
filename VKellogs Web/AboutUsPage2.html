        <h2>Our <span class="highlight">History</span></h2>
        <p>
          Our journey began in 1894, when our founder <b>W.K. Kellogg</b> <br />
          reimagined the future of food with the creation of Corn Flakes, <br />
          changing breakfast forever.<br /><br />
          Since then, we have embraced the same spirit of innovation and <br />
          entrepreneurship in everything we do, channeling our founder’s <br />
          passion and commitment to creating high quality and delicious <br />
          products while fostering communities. 
        </p>
